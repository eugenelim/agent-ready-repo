# agentbundle changelog

All notable changes to the `agentbundle` Python package.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
the package targets pre-1.0 semver as documented in `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`
— a minor bump on a 0.x release MAY be breaking.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`agentbundle install`/`upgrade` no longer require a `catalogue` argument
  (RFC-0046).** When omitted, the source resolves through a four-layer,
  first-match-wins chain: an explicit `catalogue` positional › your
  `config set source` value › an editable clone (`pip install -e`, detected
  via PEP 610 and walked up to the catalogue root, bounded by the enclosing
  `.git` repo) › a packaged default (`git+https://github.com/eugenelim/agent-ready-repo`).
  So a public user runs `agentbundle install --pack core` with no URL, and a
  gateway-bound editable fork defaults to its own clone — with no repo-committed
  source and no cwd fall-back (a code-provenance boundary). New `source` user
  config key (`config set/get/unset source`). The discovery verbs `list-packs`
  / `list-profiles` still take an explicit catalogue. Layer-4 integrity-pinning
  (pin `main` to a SHA + verify the archive digest) is a named follow-on.

### Changed

- **`agentbundle list-packs` and `list-profiles` word-wrap the DESCRIPTION
  column to fit the terminal.** On an interactive terminal whose width the
  table would overflow, the long description column wraps to the leftover
  width — every physical line stays within the terminal, continuation lines
  align under the column, and the columns that follow it (DEPENDENCIES) stay on
  the row's first line. When stdout is **not** a terminal (piped or
  redirected), output is unchanged: full content-width columns, untruncated, so
  `grep`/`awk`/`cut` still see stable columns — the convention `gh`, `git`, and
  `ls` follow. Both commands now share one terminal-aware table renderer.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-24

### Changed

- **`agentbundle uninstall` gains `--dry-run` and `--yes`, and confirms before
  removing.** It classifies each recorded file into `remove` (Tier-1, bundle-
  owned) or `keep` (Tier-2, adopter-edited): `--dry-run` prints that plan and
  writes nothing (no removal, no hook-wiring unproject, no state change);
  otherwise it confirms before the first `os.remove` (`--yes` skips; a non-TTY
  stdin refuses rather than blocking). The execution acts on the previewed
  classification without re-hashing, so the bytes a dry-run / prompt shows are
  exactly the bytes removed. Tier-2 preservation is unchanged.
- **`agentbundle install --force` confirms before its destructive cleanup; new
  `--yes`.** When `--force` would delete on-disk paths, it lists the deletion
  unit — the dist-tree subtree roots (`claude-plugins/<pack>`, `apm/<pack>`) or
  the orphan files — and confirms before deleting; the whole destructive block
  (rmtree + state-row drop + state-file rewrite) is gated atomically, so a
  decline mutates nothing. `--yes` skips the prompt; a non-TTY without `--yes`
  refuses with zero deletions. `--force` used only as a cross-scope bypass (no
  deletion) is unchanged and never prompts. **Migration:** CI using the deleting
  form of `install --force` must add `--yes`.
- **`agentbundle install` offers to upgrade an already-installed pack.** Instead
  of flatly refusing with `use 'upgrade'`, installing a pack already present at
  the requested scope now offers (on a TTY) to run `upgrade` against the same
  catalogue/scope; `install --yes` runs it without prompting. A non-interactive
  stdin without `--yes`, and `install --dry-run`, keep the historical refusal.
- **`agentbundle reconcile` and `list-targets` drop their dead `--scope` flag.**
  `reconcile --scope` had a single legal value (`user`) equal to its default, and
  `list-targets --scope` was parsed but never read. Both are removed; passing
  `--scope` to either now reports `unknown flag for <verb>: --scope`. Default
  behaviour is unchanged.

- **`agentbundle upgrade` no longer takes `--to` (breaking).** The upgrade
  target is now derived from the resolved catalogue's `pack.toml` `[pack]
  version` — the catalogue is the single source of truth, and there is no
  version-history store to select from (`--to` was `required` but never
  validated against the catalogue's actual version). The command shows
  `installed → target`, asks before writing, and the success recap names both
  versions (`upgraded: <pack> @ <scope> <from> -> <to>`). When the installed
  version already equals the target, it says so and offers to re-apply.
  Migration: drop `--to <version>`; add `--yes` for non-interactive / CI use.
  To move to a specific past version, point the catalogue at that git ref.

### Added

- **`agentbundle upgrade --yes`** skips the confirmation prompt for
  non-interactive use; without it, a non-TTY stdin refuses (with guidance to
  pass `--yes`) rather than blocking on a prompt.

### Fixed

- **`agentbundle upgrade` rejects two per-primitive flags at once.** The
  `--skill` / `--agent` / `--hook` / `--seed` / `--command` flags are now a
  mutually-exclusive group; previously passing two silently upgraded only the
  first.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Kiro custom agents now reach the bundle's skills — CLI and IDE** (RFC-0022
  erratum E4; adapter contract v0.15). On both Kiro targets, only the *default*
  agent auto-discovers skills; a *custom* agent (`kiro --agent <name>`, every
  headless `--no-interactive` run, or an IDE subagent) loaded **zero** skills
  unless it declared them in its `resources` field (kiro #6887/#6888/#4993). The
  `kiro-cli` and `kiro-ide` agent projections now inject a skill-resources glob
  (`skill://.kiro/skills/**/SKILL.md` plus the `~/.kiro/skills/**/SKILL.md`
  user-scope twin) into every projected agent — CLI into the agent JSON, IDE
  into the `.md` YAML frontmatter (quoted, YAML-safe). An agent that declares
  its own `resources` keeps it; the deprecated `kiro` alias inherits the IDE
  behavior. Default-agent runs were already fine and are unaffected.

### Added

- **`inject-resources` adapter-contract field** (contract v0.15). A typed,
  optional array on an adapter's agent projection entry that injects a fixed
  `resources` list into every projected agent. Currently used by the two Kiro
  adapters for skill reachability (above).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Curated install profiles — `install --profile <name>` and `list-profiles`**
  (RFC-0034). A profile is a first-party `profiles/<name>.toml` at a catalogue
  root naming a single-scope, deps-first set of packs an adopter installs in
  one command. `agentbundle install --profile <name> <catalogue>` pins one
  scope and one adapter for the whole batch, runs the full read-only pre-flight
  for every pack before writing any, then installs each in authored order;
  `agentbundle list-profiles <catalogue>` browses what a catalogue offers.
  Adds zero primitives and zero adapter-contract surface — the CLI reads the
  manifest, the catalogue carries it.

### Fixed

- **`agentbundle install --adapter kiro` now behaves exactly like `kiro-ide`**
  (RFC-0022 alias parity). The `kiro` → `kiro-ide` alias is now canonicalized
  at every install-path decision site, not just the build registry.
- **`--version` reports the package version.** `CLI_VERSION` had drifted to
  `0.1.0` and was printed by `agentbundle --version` regardless of the released
  version; it now tracks the package version (`0.5.0`).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **`pack.toml` is the rich source of truth for pack metadata** (RFC-0031,
  adapter contract v0.14). A pack may now declare `license`,
  `[[pack.maintainers]]`, `[pack.links]`, `categories`, `keywords`, a `readme`
  pointer, and a `[pack.metadata.<tool>]` escape hatch. The build projects the
  cleanly-mappable subset — plus the pack's `README.md` — into each
  distribution route's manifest (`plugin.json` / `marketplace.json` entry), so
  a catalogue describes each pack richly instead of with one sentence. **All new
  fields are optional**; packs pinned below contract v0.14 are unaffected.
- **Soft `categories` vocabulary** — `agentbundle validate` recognizes a
  default set of category slugs and emits a **warning (exit 0)**, never an
  error, on an unknown slug. The vocabulary is extensible by design (RFC-0031
  D8); `design` is included for the `design-craft` pack.
- **`list-packs` surfaces the enriched metadata** so a catalogue is browsable
  by more than name and a one-line description.

### Changed

- **Pack and plugin-manifest JSON schemas accept the optional enriched fields**
  (the `additionalProperties: false` gate on both manifest schemas was relaxed
  for the projectable metadata subset).

### Fixed

- **`build-self` no longer emits untracked per-quadrant guide READMEs.** The
  self-host projection skips `docs/guides/**` (adopters still receive guide
  scaffolds via seed delivery).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-12

### Changed

- **README rewritten for adoption** — quick start, a common-commands
  reference, and the "npm for your coding agent" framing; the PyPI summary
  now matches.
- **Static-analysis annotations** carried in from the repo's SAST gate
  (ADR-0017): `# nosec B310` on the constant-base GitHub-archive fetch and
  `usedforsecurity=False` on the non-security finding-ID digest. No runtime
  behaviour change.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Cursor full-parity distribution adapter** (RFC-0026) — projects all
  primitives for both install scopes via the single-writer
  `.cursor/` model.
- **Gemini CLI full-parity distribution adapter** (RFC-0027) — keeps and
  maps tools, projects a tier model map, supports the
  `gemini-command-toml` mode, and bridges `AGENTS.md` through the
  single-writer `.gemini/settings.json`.
- **`--dry-run` for `install` and `upgrade`** — preview the projection
  without writing any files.
- **Upgrade surfaces Tier-2 companion-drops** — `upgrade` now reports the
  `.upstream` companion files that an adopter must reconcile by hand.
- **credbroker install-time user-scope delivery rail** — the build
  pipeline vendors `credbroker` to `.agentbundle/lib` (drift-gated) and
  consumer bootstraps append the `~/.agentbundle/lib` floor at lowest
  precedence (new `user_libs` module).

### Changed

- **Copilot adapter projects skills as first-class `SKILL.md`** and
  corrects the web-tool documentation (adapter contract v0.12).
- **Codex adapter projects agent model and tool config** into the
  generated agent TOML.
- **Pack admittance** — credentialed packs admit the `copilot` and
  `cursor` adapters (RFC-0013 erratum); `research` and `architect` opt
  into the `cursor` adapter.

### Removed

- **Retired the shared-libs shim projection.** Credentialed skills now
  `import credbroker` from the user-scope lib floor instead of a
  build-projected shim.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-26

### Removed (breaking)

- `agentbundle.credentials` — the public loader module (`load_credentials`,
  `Credentials`, `CredentialsMissingError`, `Tier2HardFailError`,
  `parse_env_file`, `EnvParseError`).
- `agentbundle.creds` — the entire subpackage (`loader`, `exceptions`,
  `_keychain_macos`, `_credman_windows`), including the schema parser
  `_parse_schema` and the `CredsSchema` / `KeyDef` dataclasses.
- `agentbundle creds` CLI subcommand and its four verbs (`setup`,
  `check`, `where`, `rm`).

### Migration recipe (RFC-0013 § 9)

Out-of-tree credentialed skills that previously imported the loader
from `agentbundle.credentials` must change four things to migrate to
0.2.0. None of the four are optional; missing one leaves the import
unresolvable.

**1. Add four frontmatter declarations** to the skill's `SKILL.md`
(nested under the `metadata:` escape hatch):

```yaml
metadata:
  credentialed: true
  primitive-class: credentialed-cli
  auth: creds                       # selects the build-projected shim broker
  namespace: <your-namespace>       # matches your creds-schema.toml
  keys: ["<KEY>"]                   # the secret keys this skill resolves
```

The build pipeline reads `auth: creds` to decide which skills receive
the projected shim. Without that line the projection doesn't fire.

**2. Change the import line** in each script that resolves
credentials:

```python
# Before (0.1.x)
from agentbundle.credentials import (
    CredentialsMissingError,
    Tier2HardFailError,
    load_credentials,
)

# After (0.2.0)
from .credentials_shim import (
    CredentialsMissingError,
    Tier2HardFailError,
    load_credentials,
)
```

**3. Run `make build-self`** in the catalogue's clone (or invoke
`agentbundle install --pack credential-brokers --scope user .` if
you install via the CLI). This materialises the three shim files —
`credentials_shim.py`, `_keychain_macos.py`, `_credman_windows.py`
— into your skill's `scripts/` directory. Without this step the
relative import resolves to nothing and you get
`ModuleNotFoundError`.

**4. Replace `agentbundle creds setup <namespace>` invocations** in
docs and error messages with the `credential-setup` skill — shipped
by the `credential-brokers` pack at user scope. Authors invoke it
from their agent's skill loader instead of from the shell. There is
no longer an `agentbundle creds` CLI verb.

Verification: invoke the consumer skill's own `check` verb (or
equivalent low-stakes call). The shim walks Tier 1 → 2 → 3 the same
way the prior loader did and surfaces the same exceptions; no
behavioural delta.

### Adopter pin policy

Pin to `agentbundle < 0.2` in your dependency manifest until you have
completed the migration above. The pre-0.2 minor (`0.1.0`) is the
intended rollback target; that release ships from the `agentbundle-v0.1.0`
git tag and is published from the same release workflow this PR
amends. Adopters who cannot migrate immediately should stay on
`agentbundle < 0.2` until they have shipped the four-step recipe.

If no `agentbundle-v0.1.0` tag exists on the upstream remote at the
time you read this changelog, the rollback target has not yet been
published — open a release issue against the catalogue requesting
one before bumping any production pin.

### Why this is breaking inside the 0.x window

Per RFC-0013 § *Drawbacks* — the migration removes a public surface
that one or more out-of-tree consumers may depend on. The deprecation
window inside 0.x is the prior minor (0.1.0) staying available on
PyPI; the migration recipe above is mechanical (one import-line
change per consumer); and the new shim is byte-equivalent (per
spec § AC6) to the prior loader's behaviour. No behavioural change.

## [0.1.0] — pre-0.2.0

The `agentbundle` build / install / adapt CLI and the
`agentbundle.credentials` public loader surface. See `docs/CHARTER.md`
and `docs/specs/skill-secrets/spec.md` for the historical scope.
