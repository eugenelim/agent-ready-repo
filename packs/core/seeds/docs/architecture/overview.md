## Apps and packages

<!--
Replace this section with a real listing of your apps and packages.
The ideal entry tells an agent: what is this, what does it depend on, and
where do I look first?

- `apps/web/` — the public-facing web app (Next.js). Depends on `packages/api-client`,
  `packages/ui`. Entry point: `app/page.tsx`.
- `packages/api-client/` — typed HTTP client for the API. Generated from
  the OpenAPI spec in `apps/api/openapi.yaml`.
- ...
-->

<!--
Optional section. If this project ships skill/agent packs, list them
here with a one-line purpose each. Delete this section if you don't
ship packs.

Example:

- `<pack-name>` — <one-line purpose>. <scope: repo-only / user-scope / both>.
-->
<list your packs and packages here>

## Conventions you'll see across packages

<!--
Things that are true of every package in the monorepo. Example:

- Every package has its own `AGENTS.md` describing package-specific rules.
- Every package exports a `package.json` with `main`, `module`, and `types`.
- Every package has a `README.md` aimed at human consumers.

Add yours here.

## Where to start

<!--
A short, opinionated path for someone new to the repo. Example:

1. Read [`docs/CHARTER.md`](../CHARTER.md) — the project's mission and scope.
2. Read this file (architecture overview).
3. Skim [`docs/product/roadmap.md`](../product/roadmap.md) for current direction.
4. Pick a recent feature in `docs/specs/` and read its `spec.md` and `plan.md`
   side by side with the resulting code in `apps/` or `packages/`.
5. Look at the latest 3 ADRs in `docs/adr/` to see the kinds of decisions
   we record.
