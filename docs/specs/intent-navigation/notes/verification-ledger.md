# Verification ledger: intent navigation — navigator core

Execution observations for slice 1. The spec and plan hold the obligations;
this file holds what execution measured and where it departed from a task
row's literal method.

## Pre-execution

- 2026-10-08, engine run `08208db7-158f-4302-910e-347d55a570c8`: a fresh
  pre-EXECUTE adversarial review ran three rounds over the approved pair.
  Rounds 1 and 2 sustained five findings, all plan wiring; the owner approved
  the revision and re-approved the spec and plan the same day. Round 3 was
  clean.
- The slice branch `eugenelim/intent-navigation-slice-1` was cut from
  `feature/intent-navigation` at `8392ef8d6`, which contains the 2.30.1
  terminality repair merge `aafa2aa1b`; `git merge-base --is-ancestor
  aafa2aa1b HEAD` passed before T1.

## T1

- `python3 -m pytest packs/core/tests/skills/navigate-intents/ -q`: 54
  failed, 24 passed. Every failure is the absent module — 39 on
  `navigate_intents.py`, 15 on `intent_graph.py`. The 24 passes are
  fixture-shape checks over the committed corpora and the test-time builder.
- Interim red, by design: `tools/lint-pack-test-boundary.py` (and its
  self-test, which runs it over the real tree) reports
  `packs/core/tests/skills/navigate-intents` as a suite no runner names. T5
  adds the `Makefile` runner that satisfies it. The slice is one pull request
  whose gates run on its head, and each task's `Done when` runs only its own
  tests, so commits T1 to T4 carry this one finding and the head does not. A
  temporary `_NO_RUNNER` entry was declined because `tools/` is outside T1's
  and T5's pinned `Touches`.
