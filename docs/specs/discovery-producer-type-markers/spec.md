# Spec: Discovery-producer traceability markers

- **Status:** Shipped <!-- Draft | Approved | Implementing | Shipped | Archived -->
- **Owner:** eugenelim
- **Plan:** [`plan.md`](plan.md)
- **Constrained by:** RFC-0053 (AC36, DRIFT-G), RFC-0048 (note 04, the ladder kind/level split)
- **Shape:** mixed

> **Spec contract:** this document defines what "done" means. The implementing
> PR must match this spec, or update it. Verification must be derivable from it.

Mode: full (a published-interface change — the artifact schemas of shipped
producer skills — across two packs).

## Objective

The structural-orphan traceability lint (`work-loop`'s `lint-traceability.py`)
recognizes discovery-side producer nodes **by marker, not path**: a screen via a
`Type:` field, journey actions / blueprint services via embedded `Action:` /
`Service:` fields, and intent-ladder rungs via `Kind:` / `Level:` fields. The
grammar is documented in `CONVENTIONS.md` § 4 and the recognizer ships in the
lint, but only `frame-domain` currently *emits* markers — and as *frontmatter*,
which the chain recognizers do not read (precedent for the convention, not for the
bold-body form the lint matches). The other producer
skills — `map-screen-flow`, `map-customer-journey`, `blueprint-service`,
`frame-intent`, `decompose-intent` — do not, so a future fail-closed traceability
up-edge would be load-bearing on markers that don't exist. This change makes each
producer's artifact schema emit the exact marker its node type's recognizer reads,
closing the latent gap `docs/backlog.md#discovery-loop-type-marker-producers`
tracks. Primarily a format change to the producer skills; it also (operator-directed)
corrects the CONVENTIONS § 4 marker-form description to match the shipped lint, fixes
the `recognize_screens` glob so nested per-screen briefs are found, and lands the
intent↔chain rung mapping the lint's `recognize_ladder` docstring left "degrading."

## Boundaries

### Always do

- Emit the marker in the **exact on-disk form the lint's recognizer reads** — a
  rendered **bold-body field** (`- **Type:** screen-brief`, `- **Action:** <slug>`,
  `- **Service:** <slug>`, `- **Kind:** outcome|opportunity`, `- **Level:** capability`),
  because `field_re` matches `**Label:**`, not a YAML frontmatter key. Confirm each
  against `recognize_specs`/`recognize_screens`/`recognize_entries`/`recognize_ladder`
  and the lint's own `case_container_and_file_recognition` fixture.
- Keep markers **additive**, and ensure an **unfilled template produces no node**,
  verified by running the lint against the verbatim templates. The two gates differ
  by marker: the slug-bearing `Action`/`Service` placeholders (`<slug>`) are skipped
  by `_is_placeholder` (value starts `<`, ends `>`); the backtick-wrapped enum
  placeholders `` **Kind:** `<outcome | opportunity>` `` / `` **Level:** `<…>` ``
  (matching the template's sibling fields) are *not* caught by `_is_placeholder`
  (they start with a backtick) but are rejected by the recognizer's **value/enum
  gate** (`recognize_ladder` accepts only the literal `outcome`/`opportunity`/
  `capability` tokens) — the load-bearing gate for those. **Never write the bold marker syntax inside a template comment** — the
  lint scans every line, so a commented example would mint a phantom node (the
  comment refers to the marker by label only).

### Ask first

- Any change to a marker the lint does not yet read.

### Never do

- Add **operating-model doctrine** to `CONVENTIONS.md` (the § 4 edit here is a
  **factual erratum** correcting the marker-form description to match the shipped
  lint — operator-directed, not a policy change).
- Change the lint's recognition *semantics* (the `**Label:**` field grammar, the
  marker values, the orphan/reachability rules). The `recognize_screens`
  **recursion** fix (operator-directed ride-along) changes *where* it looks, not
  *what* it recognizes; its self-test is extended, not weakened.
- Repurpose the per-screen brief's frontmatter `type: screen-flow-brief` — it is a
  documented brief-internal, deliberately-not-a-discover-anchor marker
  (`map-screen-flow/references/agentbundle-layout.md`); the chain marker is a
  separate bold-body `Type:` field.

## Testing Strategy

Goal-based check, exercised by the lint as an integration oracle. For each
producer, build a small fixture artifact carrying the marker (in the form the
edited template now emits) under the lint's default base, run
`python3 packs/core/.apm/skills/work-loop/scripts/lint-traceability.py --root <fixture>`,
and confirm the lint reports the expected node id and produces no false orphan on a
wired chain. The lint's self-test (`test-lint-traceability.py`) must continue to
pass — extended with a **nested per-screen brief** case for the `recognize_screens`
recursion fix (the only recognizer change), never weakened.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `map-screen-flow`'s per-screen brief schema emits a bold-body
  `- **Type:** screen-brief`; `recognize_screens` recognizes a brief carrying it as a
  `screen:<stem>` node — verified by a fixture asserting the exact node id appears.
  The brief's nested path (`screens/<slug>/<screen>.md`) is now found by the
  recursion fix (AC11), so a real producer brief is recognized, not only a flat
  stand-in.
- [x] `map-customer-journey`'s journey schema emits one bold-body
  `- **Action:** <action-slug>` marker per frontstage action; a fixture journey is
  recognized as `action:<slug>` node(s) by `recognize_entries`.
- [x] `blueprint-service`'s blueprint schema emits one bold-body
  `- **Service:** <service-slug>` marker per backstage service; a fixture blueprint
  is recognized as `service:<slug>` node(s) by `recognize_entries`.
- [x] `frame-intent`'s intent schema emits an additive, optional bold-body
  `- **Kind:**` field with the recognized set `outcome | opportunity`, beside the
  existing `- **Level:**` field. `recognize_ladder` maps an intent carrying
  `Kind: outcome` → `outcome:<slug>`, `Kind: opportunity` → `opportunity:<slug>`,
  and `Level: capability` → `capability:<slug>` (a `Level: feature` / `product-vision`
  / `product-strategy` intent with no `Kind:` produces no ladder node — it maps
  downstream to a brief/spec); verified by a fixture asserting each node id. The
  field is the **discovery-chain rung tag** placing an intent on the OST
  (`outcome → opportunities → …`, RFC-0048 note 04) when the discovery model is run;
  it does **not** change the intent model — an intent still carries both an Outcome
  and an Opportunity section. (Surfaced: the lint's own `recognize_ladder` docstring
  concedes this producer↔chain reconciliation was left "degrading until it lands";
  this lands the *format*, see Surfaced decisions.)
- [x] `decompose-intent` instructs the child-intent emission to carry the `Kind:`
  (and `Level:`) marker, so a decomposed ladder rung is recognized — verified by a
  fixture child intent emitted in the form the edited step describes, run through
  the lint and asserting its node id.
- [x] A fully-wired fixture chain (intent ladder via `Parent intent:` → screen →
  action → service, plus a spec parented via `Discovery:`) recognizes every producer
  node **by its exact id** (the unambiguous recognition signal) and reports **no
  `ORPHAN`/`DANGLING`** on the wired nodes — the absence of orphans is meaningful
  only on a wired chain.
- [x] `test-lint-traceability.py` passes, **extended** with a nested per-screen
  brief case (the recursion fix) — the recognition contract is otherwise untouched.
- [x] **CONVENTIONS § 4 erratum:** the spec-metadata contract describes the
  discovery-producer marker as a **bold-body field** the lint reads (`**Type:**` /
  `**Kind:**` / `**Level:**` / `**Action:**` / `**Service:**`), not a frontmatter
  key, and notes `frame-domain`'s frontmatter `type:` is a document-level
  discover-by-marker anchor distinct from the chain recognizers' fields. A factual
  correction matching the shipped lint, not a policy change.
- [x] **`recognize_screens` recursion (core):** it walks the screens base
  recursively (mirroring `recognize_contracts`'s `_iter_dirs` walk), so a nested
  `screens/<slug>/<screen>.md` brief carrying `**Type:** screen-brief` is recognized;
  the self-test gains a nested-brief case; `core` is version-bumped
  (pack.toml + plugin.json) and `marketplace.json` regenerated. Flow files
  (`type: screen-flow`, no bold-body `**Type:** screen-brief`) are not picked up.
- [x] **Intent↔chain reconciliation landed:** `frame-intent/references/intent-model.md`
  documents the `Kind:`/`Level:` → chain-rung mapping (orthogonal to the intent's
  internal outcome+opportunity structure; grounded in RFC-0048 note 04's OST); the
  lint's `recognize_ladder` docstring drops "degrading until it lands" for the
  now-landed mapping; an RFC-0048 § Amendments dated note records the landing.
- [x] `experience` and `product-engineering` packs are version-bumped — the
  **top-level pack `version`** key in `pack.toml` and the `version` in
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (NOT the `[contract]` layout version) — and
  `marketplace.json` regenerated via `make build-self` with no other drift.
- [x] `docs/product/changelog.md` `[Unreleased]` carries an entry; the
  `docs/backlog.md#discovery-loop-type-marker-producers` entry is closed.

## Assumptions

- Technical: the lint recognizes markers via the **bold-body** `**Label:**` form,
  not frontmatter — verified by reading `field_re` and the
  `case_container_and_file_recognition` fixture (source: probe
  `packs/core/.apm/skills/work-loop/scripts/{lint,test-lint}-traceability.py`).
- Technical: `frame-domain` already emits `type:`/`scope-boundary` markers but as
  **frontmatter** (not read by the lint, since `domain-framing`/`scope-boundary`
  are not chain nodes) — so it is precedent for the marker *convention*, not for the
  on-disk *form* the chain recognizers need (source: probe `frame-domain/SKILL.md`).
- Technical: the per-screen brief frontmatter `type: screen-flow-brief` is
  deliberately distinct and must not be repurposed (source: probe
  `map-screen-flow/references/agentbundle-layout.md` lines 94-97).
- Process: `experience` / `product-engineering` are user-scope-default packs not in
  this repo's working-tree projection, so the version bump drifts `marketplace.json`
  only; `make build-self` regenerates it (source:
  [[non-projected-pack-bump-drifts-marketplace]] memory).

## Resolved here (originally surfaced)

Three items the first cut surfaced for the owner are, on operator direction, resolved
in this PR (AC10–AC12):

1. **CONVENTIONS § 4 marker-form drift** — § 4 described the marker as "frontmatter
   `type:`" while the lint reads a bold-body `**Type:**` field; an adopter following
   § 4 would emit an unrecognized frontmatter marker. Corrected as a **factual
   erratum** (the docs misdescribed the shipped lint), not an operating-model policy
   change — so it does not require the `update-conventions` RFC path. `frame-domain`'s
   frontmatter `type:` is noted as a document-level discover-by-marker anchor, distinct
   from the chain recognizers' bold-body fields.
2. **Screen glob↔nested-path gap** — `recognize_screens` now walks the screens base
   recursively (the `recognize_contracts` precedent), so a real nested
   `screens/<slug>/<screen>.md` brief is recognized, not only a flat stand-in (AC11).
   Flow files lack the bold-body `screen-brief` marker, so they are not picked up.
3. **Intent↔chain reconciliation** — grounded in RFC-0048 note 04's OST, the
   `Kind:`/`Level:` → chain-rung mapping is now documented in `intent-model.md`
   (orthogonal to the intent's internal outcome+opportunity structure), the lint's
   `recognize_ladder` docstring drops "degrading until it lands," and an RFC-0048
   § Amendments note records the landing (AC12). This *implements* note 04's decided
   ontology; it mints no new value call.
