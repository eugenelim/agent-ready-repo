## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`architect-design` now consults the enterprise's own knowledge when the
  environment exposes a retrieval surface (architect pack 0.3.0).** A new
  progressive-disclosure reference (`knowledge-surfaces.md`) carries an 8-area
  MECE knowledge taxonomy — business domain, current landscape, interfaces,
  operational reality, constraints & standards, patterns, decisions, in-flight —
  plus a **harness-agnostic detection** mechanism that discovers a retrieval
  surface (an MCP knowledge tool, an internal CLI, an in-repo doc set) from the
  session itself, hardcoding no tool name. A single conditional procedure step
  loads the reference **only when a surface is detected**, and otherwise
  **degrades gracefully** — asks for the missing context, lowers confidence, and
  never fabricates landscape/standards/in-flight facts — reusing the existing
  compose-with-`research` framing. No knowledge server or RAG engine ships (out
  of charter); no registry, shared config, or cross-pack dependency.
  `architect-review`/`architect-diagram` and a `product-engineering` sibling are
  deferred follow-ups.

- **The `product-engineering` pack gains its business-unit cross-component layer
  (pack 0.2.0).** A product org whose work fans out across **many component
  repos** can now stand up a **value-stream meta-repo** — a coordinating repo with
  no app code — via a new pure-markdown skill, **`align-value-stream`**. It holds
  the cross-cutting artifacts a polyrepo has nowhere else to put: a **federated
  Backstage catalog** (Domain→System→Component→API, referencing each repo's own
  `catalog-info.yaml`, never re-authored), the **shared-contract authority**
  (referenced by `contract@version` with a read-only courier snapshot, never
  forked), the **C4/bounded-context architecture**, and a **cross-component
  delivery rollup**. At business-unit scale `decompose-intent` now **slices a
  feature intent per component** into one `core` brief per repo, each carrying an
  optional **`parent-intent:`** provenance pointer (the one additive, never-
  interpreted `core` brief field, distinct from `Epic:`), a versioned contract
  reference, and a `providesApi`/`consumesApi` role; each brief crosses into its
  component repo where `receive-brief` → `new-spec` → `work-loop` take over, and
  the meta-repo rolls up "delivered across **all** components?" The rollup is a
  **markdown snapshot** (absent-source rows show `unknown / not-yet-catalogued`,
  never silently delivered) — **no runtime hub, no live API, no validator, no new
  subagent**. The hard limits are stated honestly: **no atomic cross-repo commit,
  no shared release train, snapshot-not-live**. Habits, not infrastructure
  (RFC-0030 phase 2, ADR-0022).

- **A new opt-in `product-engineering` pack shapes product intent into the specs
  your delivery loop already builds (pack 0.1.0).** Three pure-markdown skills —
  `frame-intent`, `de-risk-intent`, `decompose-intent` — work a recursive,
  level-tagged `intent` (a capability intent and a feature intent are the same
  artifact at different levels; a PRD is a feature intent written as a document).
  Name an outcome and the opportunity behind it, de-risk the riskiest assumption
  against a **predeclared kill condition** under a choosable **prototype-approach**
  (`prototype-led` ↔ `validate-first`), then decompose to a shippable spec — at app
  scale the leaf *is* a `core` brief, so `receive-brief` → `new-spec` → `work-loop`
  take it from there with **no change to `core`**. One global **Scale** axis (app ↔
  business-unit) plus per-intent maturity / reversibility / prototype-approach flags;
  one-way tracker projection (Linear / Jira Align / none); habits, not infrastructure.
  v1 is app/solo + single-component; the business-unit cross-component value-stream
  layer is a later phase (RFC-0030, ADR-0019).

- **The `architect` pack designs *and* reviews cloud architecture to the
  well-architected standard, and the design skill now converges (architect pack
  0.2.0).** `architect-design` shapes a one-page **concept first**, makes the
  design **well-architected by construction** for the chosen provider — AWS /
  Azure / GCP, **primitives providers like Hetzner** (it names the capability
  gaps you must build yourself), or **local-first** (the local→production delta +
  graduation path) — and then runs a **convergence loop**: it obtains a review
  pass, **auto-resolves the mechanical findings** without asking, re-reviews, and
  **surfaces only the judgment calls** (tradeoffs, risk acceptances,
  low-confidence assumptions) to you as decisions. `architect-review` gains a
  **well-architected / lens mode** (security · FinOps · SRE · DR · data ·
  compliance · green concern-lenses, plus ML / **GenAI-agentic** / SaaS /
  serverless workload-class lenses) that emits a risk register with every finding
  tagged **mechanical / judgment** — the signal the design loop consumes. The
  loop is an enhancement when both skills are present and degrades to an embedded
  rubric self-check when it isn't; for genuinely novel domains the design takes a
  **leading-edge path** that composes with the `research` skill when available and
  degrades to flagged-novelty + lowered-confidence when absent. Pure-markdown, no
  subagents, no new pack; the loop is an in-conversation procedure with no script
  or state file. `architect-diagram` gains a `cloud-primitives` diagram vocab for
  parity with its AWS/Azure/GCP references.
- **The `security-reviewer` is stronger, current, and shifts left (core pack 0.4.0).**
  Security review is no longer only a late gate: on security-boundary work the
  `work-loop` now dispatches the reviewer in a **spec-stage secure-design mode**
  at the pre-EXECUTE step, asking whether each control is specified as an
  acceptance criterion *at the right depth* (confinement, not just traversal;
  a scheme/host allowlist, not "validate the URL"; broker-mediated secrets, not
  ad-hoc reads) — collapsing post-implementation round-trips into one design-time
  pass. The awareness stack is current — **OWASP Top 10:2025** (replacing the
  2021 list), ASVS 5.0, API Security Top 10:2023, OWASP LLM Top 10:2025, CWE
  Top 25 — and a **STRIDE + LINDDUN** open pass adds the privacy lens STRIDE
  blind-spots. Depth ships through a new **`security-checklists` skill**: ten
  boundary-keyed modules the orchestrator loads *per boundary the change
  crosses* and inlines into the reviewer's brief, so the lens is deep without
  bloating the prompt and travels to every adapter with **no contract change**.
  Tool-delegation is now language-agnostic (`npm audit` / `pip-audit` /
  `govulncheck` / `cargo audit` / Snyk / Semgrep / CodeQL) and fails honestly
  (`degraded: no scanner`) rather than silently skipping. A new **established-helper
  bypass** meta-check flags code that rolled its own where the repo has a blessed
  helper — customize the list via a light "blessed security tools/helpers" point
  in `AGENTS.md`. Complements, does not replace, the SAST/SCA scanners (ADR-0017).
  See RFC-0029 / ADR-0018.

- **The default quality floor is now higher by doctrine (core pack 0.3.0).**
  Agent output tends to clear a strict external static-analysis gate (a
  SonarQube quality profile, a CI-only coverage threshold) regardless of tech
  stack, without bundling any linter, shipping any threshold, or detecting the
  repo's shape. Three coordinated, stack-agnostic changes: (1) the
  `quality-engineer` reviewer gains four universal code-smell findings —
  bounded complexity (split what's *reducible*, complementing the existing
  comment-the-irreducible finding), nesting depth (idiom-appropriate
  flattening, not a mandated early `return`), duplicated production blocks past
  the rule-of-three (tests stay DAMP), and magic-literals/parameter-bloat
  (judgment-based, threshold-free) — plus a mutation-testing-mindset Test
  Design headline ("a test must be able to fail") as the Goodhart-safe stand-in
  for chasing a coverage number; (2) `work-loop` gains a **simplify pass** in
  EXECUTE/REVIEW that shrinks the diff before review — harness-agnostic
  doctrine, with Claude Code's `/simplify` an optional accelerant, never a
  dependency; and (3) light mode now **retains** the `quality-engineer` pass
  when the adopter declares in their `AGENTS.md` that the repo is judged by a
  strict external gate the local loop can't run (adopter-declared policy, not
  repo detection). Mode *mechanics* begin migrating out of `CONVENTIONS.md`
  into the `work-loop` skill as their single owner.

- **The repo now has a SAST/SCA gate** — `make sast` runs **Bandit** (Python pattern SAST),
  **pip-audit** (dependency/SCA), **Semgrep** (cross-cutting SAST, including custom `mode: taint`
  rules under `tools/semgrep/`), and a **CodeQL** code-scanning workflow (deep interprocedural
  taint — the open-source analogue of Snyk Code). The first three are chained into
  `make build-check` so every PR is scanned by the repo's own single native gate (locally and in
  `build-check.yml` CI); CodeQL runs as its own workflow. Bandit fails on medium-or-higher findings
  (tuning in `bandit.yaml`). The genuine findings surfaced were fixed in the same change: weak SHA-1
  digests marked `usedforsecurity=False`; the arXiv retriever upgraded to HTTPS; the `session-start`
  hook's env-var path overrides sanitized against directory traversal (a fix every adopter inherits);
  and the SSO broker's `test` verb now rejects non-`http(s)` URL schemes. A committed `.snyk` policy
  file is the Snyk-native suppression vehicle for the organisational scan. All four scanners are
  CI-only dev tools (`tools/requirements-sast.txt`) and are **never** added to a shipped package's
  runtime dependencies. See ADR-0017.

- **Gemini CLI is now a full-parity adapter** — `agentbundle install --adapter gemini` (repo or
  user scope) projects every catalogue primitive to Gemini CLI's native `.gemini/*` layout:
  skills → `.gemini/skills/`, subagents → `.gemini/agents/<name>.md` (the `tools:` allowlist is
  **kept** and name-mapped to Gemini's tool ids — `Read`→`read_file`, `Bash`→`run_shell_command`,
  … — and `model` maps tier-preserving to the Gemini 2.5 line), commands →
  `.gemini/commands/<name>.toml`, and hook bodies → `.gemini/hooks/` with the wiring + a managed
  `context.fileName = ["AGENTS.md", "GEMINI.md"]` bridge merged into `.gemini/settings.json` so the
  canonical `AGENTS.md` is read. Every pack admits `gemini` at both scopes. Previously Gemini CLI
  got nothing (it doesn't read `AGENTS.md` by default). Contract v0.12 → v0.13 (RFC-0027 /
  ADR-0016). Distribution-only.
- **Cursor can now install the `research` and `architect` packs** — both packs added `cursor`
  to their `allowed-adapters`, so `agentbundle install --pack research --adapter cursor` (and
  `--pack architect`) now projects their skills to `.cursor/skills/` — and, for `research`, the
  two retrieval subagents to `.cursor/agents/` with `readonly: true` — instead of refusing the
  install up front. The Cursor adapter shipped in the previous release, but no pack had opted
  in. (The credentialed packs are covered by the next entry.)
- **Credentialed packs can now install via Cursor and Copilot** — `atlassian`, `contracts`,
  `converters`, `figma`, and `credential-brokers` added `copilot` + `cursor` to their
  `allowed-adapters`, so a Cursor- or Copilot-based adopter can install them (and the SSO/token
  broker lands at `~/.agentbundle/bin/` as before — the broker delivery is adapter-independent).
  Previously these packs admitted only `claude-code`, `kiro-ide`, and `codex`. Recorded as an
  RFC-0013 § Errata decision; no contract change (both adapters already declare the
  `.agentbundle/` install prefix the broker needs).
- **`--dry-run` previews an install or upgrade without writing anything** —
  `agentbundle install --dry-run` and `agentbundle upgrade --dry-run` run the
  full read-only pre-flight, print a per-file plan to stdout (one
  `<action> <tier> <target>` line each — `create` / `overwrite` /
  `companion`, with Tier-2 lines naming the `.upstream.<ext>` companion the
  real run would drop), and exit 0 without touching the tree, state, or
  install marker. A present Tier-2 collision does not change the exit code;
  the preview is informational. `install --dry-run --force` is refused
  (`--force`'s destructive cleanup is incompatible with a read-only preview).
  The install preview covers the rendered adapter projection; it does not yet
  enumerate the governance seeds (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/CHARTER.md`,
  `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`) a real install also delivers. See the
  [preview how-to](../guides/how-to/preview-install-or-upgrade.md).

### Changed

- **`agentbundle upgrade` tells you when it keeps your edits** — when a
  projected file you edited since install collides with the new version
  (Tier-2), the upgrade preserves your file and drops the upstream version
  as a `<path>.upstream.<ext>` companion, exactly as before. It now also
  prints, on stderr after the upgrade commits, how many files were kept
  and the companion path of each — so you can find them and run
  `adapt-to-project` to merge. Parity with what `install` already reports;
  no change to the file-safety contract (the CLI still never clobbers or
  prompts). Per
  [RFC-0001 § Errata (2026-06-11)](../rfc/0001-bundle-distribution-by-adapter-spec.md#errata),
  which reconciles the original draft's unbuilt in-CLI Tier-2 prompt with
  this deterministic companion-drop design.

- **Leaner work-loop context use, same rigor** — the review reviewers
  (`adversarial-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `quality-engineer`) now return
  only their distilled findings block (or `Clean — ready to commit.`), with no
  pre-findings methodology recap or process narration. The `work-loop` skill
  drops the full reviewer report from resident context once findings are
  recorded — the on-disk report plus `state.json` fingerprints are the durable
  record — and gains a `## Context hygiene` section with three context-saving
  levers (reference-read reduction, task-boundary compaction, narrowest-gate
  during FIX), each with a portable no-subagent floor, plus a "reduce, never
  lossily transform" guardrail. No verification surface changes: gates, the
  iterate-to-Clean loop, fingerprint stasis detection, the quality-engineer
  floor, and the iteration cap all behave exactly as before. See
  [`docs/specs/work-loop-context-hygiene/`](../specs/work-loop-context-hygiene/spec.md).

- **Codex receives full skill bodies** — the `skill` projection for the
  Codex adapter flips from `managed-block-inline` (one-line teasers
  in `AGENTS.md` between `<!-- agent-skills:start -->` /
  `<!-- agent-skills:end -->`) to `direct-directory`. Codex users now
  read `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` byte-equal to source — the
  same surface Claude Code and Kiro have always had. Per
  [RFC-0009 § Adapter contract change](../rfc/0009-codex-native-skills.md#adapter-contract-change).
  On the first install after upgrade, the adapter strips the
  legacy `<!-- agent-skills:start --> … <!-- agent-skills:end -->`
  region from any pre-existing `AGENTS.md` in place; outside-block
  content is preserved. The strip is destructive by design: hand-
  edited content *between* the delimiters is not migrated
  (RFC-0009 § Failure modes). The strip mechanism
  (`_strip_legacy_skill_block` + the retained `_splice_managed_block`
  helper) is kept for one minor release as the migration window
  (released N) and then removed in the release after (N+1).
  **Self-host mirrors Codex repo projection.** The self-host allow-list
  includes both `claude-code` and `codex`, so this repo now carries
  Codex's repo-scope projection alongside Claude Code: `.agents/skills/`
  for full skill bodies, `.codex/agents/` for subagent TOML, and
  `.codex/hooks.json` for hook wiring. `make build-check` enforces those
  paths the same way it enforces `.claude/`.

- **Uniform multi-pack entry point across `direct-directory` adapters**
  — `codex`, `claude-code`, and `kiro` all expose
  `project_packs(pack_paths, contract, output_root)` as the
  canonical orchestrator-facing surface. Single-pack `project()`
  is retained as a wrapper. Same-name skill collisions across
  packs resolve deterministic-last-wins by source-order.

- **Orphan-skill cleanup across `direct-directory` adapters** — after
  every multi-pack `project_packs(...)` call, the projected skill
  directory is swept: child directories whose names are not in the
  union of source skill names across the call's pack list are
  removed. Bound to the `skill` primitive only; symlinks are
  removed via `Path.unlink()` (never followed).
