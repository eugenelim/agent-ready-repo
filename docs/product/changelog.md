# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> Maintenance: this file is updated in the same PR that introduces the
> change. CI will warn (configurable: block) when a PR touches code that
> changes user-visible behavior but does not touch this file.
>
> Entries can be drafted from conventional commits: `git log --oneline`
> filtered to `feat:` and `fix:` since the last tag is a starting point,
> not a finished product. Rewrite for users, not contributors. See the
> [Common Changelog guidance](https://common-changelog.org/) — the audience

### Changed

- **Codex receives full skill bodies** — the `skill` projection for the
  Codex adapter flips from `managed-block-inline` (one-line teasers
  in `AGENTS.md` between `<!-- agent-skills:start -->` /
  `<!-- agent-skills:end -->`) to `direct-directory`. Codex users now
  read `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` byte-equal to source — the
  same surface Claude Code and Kiro have always had. Per
  [RFC-0009 § Adapter contract change](../rfc/0009-codex-native-skills.md#adapter-contract-change).
  On the first install after upgrade, the adapter strips the
  legacy `<!-- agent-skills:start --> … <!-- agent-skills:end -->`
  region from any pre-existing `AGENTS.md` in place; outside-block
  content is preserved. The strip is destructive by design: hand-
  edited content *between* the delimiters is not migrated
  (RFC-0009 § Failure modes). The strip mechanism
  (`_strip_legacy_skill_block` + the retained `_splice_managed_block`
  helper) is kept for one minor release as the migration window
  (released N) and then removed in the release after (N+1).
  **Self-host narrowed to Claude Code only.** Before this release,
  `SELF_HOST_ADAPTERS = ("claude-code", "codex")` so the Codex
  adapter ran against this repo's working tree alongside Claude
  Code. With Codex's `skill` projection growing from a tiny
  AGENTS.md managed block to a full body tree, self-host's working
  tree would carry a duplicate `.agents/skills/` of every skill —
  pure maintainer overload. `SELF_HOST_ADAPTERS = ("claude-code",)`
  now; Codex adopters continue to receive `.agents/skills/` via
  `agentbundle install`. Codex regressions are gated by the
  adapter's unit tests and a tempdir projection test that walks
  every shipped skill.

- **Uniform multi-pack entry point across `direct-directory` adapters**
  — `codex`, `claude-code`, and `kiro` all expose
  `project_packs(pack_paths, contract, output_root)` as the
  canonical orchestrator-facing surface. Single-pack `project()`
  is retained as a wrapper. Same-name skill collisions across
  packs resolve deterministic-last-wins by source-order.

- **Orphan-skill cleanup across `direct-directory` adapters** — after
  every multi-pack `project_packs(...)` call, the projected skill
  directory is swept: child directories whose names are not in the
  union of source skill names across the call's pack list are
  removed. Bound to the `skill` primitive only; symlinks are
  removed via `Path.unlink()` (never followed).
