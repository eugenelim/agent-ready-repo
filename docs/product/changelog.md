# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> Maintenance: this file is updated in the same PR that introduces the

> changes user-visible behavior but does not touch this file.
>
> Entries can be drafted from conventional commits: `git log --oneline`
> filtered to `feat:` and `fix:` since the last tag is a starting point,
> not a finished product. Rewrite for users, not contributors. See the

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`--dry-run` previews an install or upgrade without writing anything** —
  `agentbundle install --dry-run` and `agentbundle upgrade --dry-run` run the
  full read-only pre-flight, print a per-file plan to stdout (one
  `<action> <tier> <target>` line each — `create` / `overwrite` /
  `companion`, with Tier-2 lines naming the `.upstream.<ext>` companion the
  real run would drop), and exit 0 without touching the tree, state, or
  install marker. A present Tier-2 collision does not change the exit code;
  the preview is informational. `install --dry-run --force` is refused
  (`--force`'s destructive cleanup is incompatible with a read-only preview).
  The install preview covers the rendered adapter projection; it does not yet
  enumerate the governance seeds (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/CHARTER.md`,
  `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`) a real install also delivers. See the
  [preview how-to](../guides/how-to/preview-install-or-upgrade.md).

### Changed

- **`agentbundle upgrade` tells you when it keeps your edits** — when a
  projected file you edited since install collides with the new version
  (Tier-2), the upgrade preserves your file and drops the upstream version
  as a `<path>.upstream.<ext>` companion, exactly as before. It now also
  prints, on stderr after the upgrade commits, how many files were kept
  and the companion path of each — so you can find them and run
  `adapt-to-project` to merge. Parity with what `install` already reports;
  no change to the file-safety contract (the CLI still never clobbers or
  prompts). Per
  [RFC-0001 § Errata (2026-06-11)](../rfc/0001-bundle-distribution-by-adapter-spec.md#errata),
  which reconciles the original draft's unbuilt in-CLI Tier-2 prompt with
  this deterministic companion-drop design.

- **Codex receives full skill bodies** — the `skill` projection for the
  Codex adapter flips from `managed-block-inline` (one-line teasers
  in `AGENTS.md` between `<!-- agent-skills:start -->` /
  `<!-- agent-skills:end -->`) to `direct-directory`. Codex users now
  read `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` byte-equal to source — the
  same surface Claude Code and Kiro have always had. Per
  [RFC-0009 § Adapter contract change](../rfc/0009-codex-native-skills.md#adapter-contract-change).
  On the first install after upgrade, the adapter strips the
  legacy `<!-- agent-skills:start --> … <!-- agent-skills:end -->`
  region from any pre-existing `AGENTS.md` in place; outside-block
  content is preserved. The strip is destructive by design: hand-
  edited content *between* the delimiters is not migrated
  (RFC-0009 § Failure modes). The strip mechanism
  (`_strip_legacy_skill_block` + the retained `_splice_managed_block`
  helper) is kept for one minor release as the migration window
  (released N) and then removed in the release after (N+1).
  **Self-host mirrors Codex repo projection.** The self-host allow-list
  includes both `claude-code` and `codex`, so this repo now carries
  Codex's repo-scope projection alongside Claude Code: `.agents/skills/`
  for full skill bodies, `.codex/agents/` for subagent TOML, and
  `.codex/hooks.json` for hook wiring. `make build-check` enforces those
  paths the same way it enforces `.claude/`.

- **Uniform multi-pack entry point across `direct-directory` adapters**
  — `codex`, `claude-code`, and `kiro` all expose
  `project_packs(pack_paths, contract, output_root)` as the
  canonical orchestrator-facing surface. Single-pack `project()`
  is retained as a wrapper. Same-name skill collisions across
  packs resolve deterministic-last-wins by source-order.

- **Orphan-skill cleanup across `direct-directory` adapters** — after
  every multi-pack `project_packs(...)` call, the projected skill
  directory is swept: child directories whose names are not in the
  union of source skill names across the call's pack list are
  removed. Bound to the `skill` primitive only; symlinks are
  removed via `Path.unlink()` (never followed).
