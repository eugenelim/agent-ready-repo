## Adding a new ADR

```bash
# Find the next number (portable across macOS, Linux, native Windows).
N=$(python3 .claude/skills/new-adr/scripts/next-ordinal.py docs/adr)

# Create from template
cp .claude/skills/new-adr/assets/adr.md docs/adr/${N}-<kebab-title>.md
```

Or, in Claude Code, run `/new-adr "<title>"` (defined in `.claude/skills/new-adr/SKILL.md`).
